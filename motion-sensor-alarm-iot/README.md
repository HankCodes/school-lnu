# Motion Sensor

This is a short description of the project

## What this is
This repository is a PIR motion sensor that will be controlled via HTTP. There will be the posibility to turn the sensor on/off and read the current state of the sensor. The sensor will also send a post request when the sensor is triggered. For a complete description see the motion-detector.td.json-file.
