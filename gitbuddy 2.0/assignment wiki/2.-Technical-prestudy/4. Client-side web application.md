## What are the pros and cons of using a client-side framework in your course assignment stack?
The biggest pro for using a client-side framework is that it gets easier to develop a complex application. 
Less boilerplate code is needed since the framework takes care of the heavy lifting and the developer can focus on what the application should do.
Depending on the framework it oftentimes provide optimization of the code as well as polyfill for older browser. This is a hue advantage since it takes away much of the otherwise complicated and timeconsuming tasks. Unexperienced developer is really helped by this since they can produce richer web appications than whay they normally could develop. 

## What can Service Workers do for your application in the course assignment?
Besides chaching resources to reduce traffic to the server and providing a offline experience the service worker will provide the posibility to generate push notification messages even when the user is not active on the site or even has the browser runnig. This will make the application feel more like a native application than a "simple website".
