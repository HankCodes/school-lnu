# Backend architecture
The largest portion of the application is the backend. All the microservices will be hosted on the same host at [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com). Even though they theoretically could be placed anywhere as long as they are accessible over the internet. At this point they will be gathered at the same place.

This document aims to clarify some of the parts of the backend and how they communicate with each other.

## Backend overview
The backend will consist of numerous smaller microservices all running in NodeJS. Since the development team will be developing all the microservices themself it will be mot friction free to use NodeJS over the whole application. However, since the services will communicate through HTTP and use JSON as data format the services are language independent.

The HTTP traffic will be handled with [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/), A popular NodeJS library for developing web servers. It is well known and it has good documentation. It does not implement security so this will be handled by each service.

### Persistent storage
There will be persistent storage for user information and the users notification. In this application, at this time there will be only one database. The database of choice is a [MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb).  
The reason for this is that a MongoDB database is easy to work with especially when using JavaScript since both work well with JSON.

### Notification service
The notification microservice will handle all users notifications. It will use the shared MongoDb database to store the notifications. A notification will hold information about what type of notification it is, who owns the notification and how the user will be notified. The notification microservice will be able to send notifications directly to the users browser as well as email and SMS.

It will get the notifications from the Application API. The Application API will provide information about the user owning the notification, if the user is online, what kind of event triggered the notification. This will provide the possibility to prevent sms/emails to go out if the user is online.

The notification microservice will receive request using HTTP with information in JSON. It will make use of the Push notification API to send notifications to the browser. The SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) will be used for sending Emails. And if not too complicated the SMS service will be implemented.

### Webhook service
The webhook microservices will handle the in comming webhooks. Since the application  will be able to support many different Git services each Git service will be implemented in its own self contained process e.g Webhook service. They will simply receive the notification from the Git service they represent and forward that request to the Webhook API. The Webhook API will, in turn, transform the request to a generic object and pass it to the Application API. The reason for this flow is to be able to integrate new Git webhooks without changing too much of the application.

### Oauth services
The Oauth microservices works similar to the Webhook services. Each Git service will have its own self hosted Oauth microservice handling the request. And again, as with the Webhook service, there will be a Oauth API that will turn the responses from the various Oauth microservices to generic responses with a payload that the Application API will be able to handle, regardless of how the Oauth url's and payloads looks from the different Git services.
