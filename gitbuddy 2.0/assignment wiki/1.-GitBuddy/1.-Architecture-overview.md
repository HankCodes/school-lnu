The application will be developed using a microservice architecture.
It will be divided in small self contained processes that will serve a single purpose. The reason for using a microservice architecture is to be able to add more git services as time progresses. At first GitLab will be the only git service available but due to the nature of a microservice architecture more git services like GitHub and Bitbucket will be added.

## The services

### Front end
The front end will be a React application. The use of a javascript framework to dynamically render client content is well suited for this kind of real time application. The frontend will be able to communicate with the backend through REST-like HTTP calls as well as websockets. The Front end will also receive notification from the backend's notification service.

### Back end
**Application API**  
This is the staring point of the backend and will handle the communication with the front end service as well as the services on the backend. Communication with front end will be served over HTTP for API calls as well as Websockets for real time updates of the application. The Application API will communicate with the other services over HTTP.

**Auth API**  
The auth API will help to abstract different authentication services. It will act as a layer between the Application API and the potentially different authentcation services used by the application. This is done to make sure that the Application API does not get affected if authentication services is swapped, added or removed. Communication will be served over HTTP. This service will format all information from the different Oauth services to ensure a uniformed format to the Application API and thus, also to the client.

**Webhook API**  
Like the Auth API this service will abstract different webhook services. It will handle requests from the different services and forward them to the Application API using HTTP making sure that the format received by the Application API is the same regardless of the webhook service being used.

**Git API**  
This service will gather the various endpoints for the git services being used by the application. The reason for not dividing theses services in smaller chunks is that the service will only forward the exact same endpoints as the original api's and dividing them further will only cause redundancy.

**GitLab Oauth**  
This service will handle the logic for authenticate a user with GitLab Oauth2.
Other services like this can be implemented if other Oauth services will be added. If so another service will be created and have the same communication with the Auth API.

**GitLab Webhook**  
This service will receive Gitlab webhook requests and forward them to the Webhook API using HTTP much in the same way as the GitLab Oauth service. The Webhook API service will format the requests from this service to ensure that the format of the payload is the same for all webhook servcies

**Notification service**  
The notification service will receive notifications from the Application API. The Application API will forward notifications originated from the various webhook requests to the Notification service. In turn the Notification service will send the appropriate notification types to the user. If the user is active on the site only a push notification to the front end is served. If the user is offline both a Push notification will be served as well as SMS or email notifications.
