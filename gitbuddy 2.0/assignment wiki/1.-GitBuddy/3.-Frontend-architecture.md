# Frontend overview
The frontend of the GitBuddy application will be written in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). The reason for choosing a web framework to build the frontend is that it gives a nice abstraction of complicated DOM-manipulation. It will make it easier to develop a rich web application. 

It will be especially suitable in the GitBuddy application for its real-time features such as rendering new content whenever the backend notifies the front end with new content. 

## The different parts
The front end consist of four parts. The ReactJS frontend, api call interface, persistent storage and a service worker.

There will be persistent storage in the form of cache for the React application making it available offline and [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) for access tokens.

### ReactJS
To provide a rich user interface react will be used to build the application. On the front end the user will be able to see the organizations/groups and their containing subgroups and projects/repositories. The will also be possible to see and interact (comment, edit and delete) with issues and pull/merge requests.

The user will also be able to choose on what project the user wants to receive notifications on as well as on what events such as new issues, pull/merge requests, comments and so on. The user can also opt in on how the notifications will be shown, push notification, email or sms.

The application will be built as a Progressive Web Application or [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application). This will enable the user to download the application on the device and use it like a [native application](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/native-application-native-app#:~:text=A%20native%20application%20is%20a,device%2Dspecific%20hardware%20and%20software.).

### API call interface
There will be an interface for making requests to the backend. This will encapsulate the endpoints and process the responses to make the development of the frontend as smooth as possible. It will handle the storage of the access token in local storage as well as making sure the token is sent with each request that needs it.

### Service worker
A [Service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) will be used to be able to cache the ReactJS application. This will make the application load faster on first load since there will be no need to fetch the application from the server. It will also make the application available offline.

The most important reason for the service worker in this application is that it opens up the possibility to use the [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API). This will let the user opt in on receiving notifications from the application even when the browser is not running. This feature will make the application feel more like a native application rather than a "simple website".


### Persistent storage
There is two cases when persistent storage will be needed. The first is to store the users access token to the git api of choice. This is needed when making the request to the git service on behalf of the user. 

[Cache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#private_browser_caches) will be used to store the application to make it usable offline as well as decrease the loading time when the user visit the site after closing the browser.
